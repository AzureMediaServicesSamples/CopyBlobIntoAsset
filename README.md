# CopyBlobIntoAsset

This sample shows how to copy existing blobs from a storage account into a new Azure Media Services asset.

Your blobs could exist in a storage account that is associated with Media Services account, or storage account that is not associated with Media Services account. This sample demonstrates how to copy blobs from a storage account into a Media Services Asset. Note that you can also copy across Data Centers. However, there may be charges incurred by doing so.
